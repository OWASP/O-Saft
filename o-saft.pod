=head1 NAME

O-Saft - OWASP SSL advanced forensic tool
    OWASP SSL audit for testers

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This tools lists  information  about remote target's  SSL certificate
and tests the remote target according given list of ciphers.

Note:  Throughout this description  C<$0>  is used as an alias for the
program name  C<o-saft.pl>.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

	o-saft.pl [COMMANDS ..] [OPTIONS ..] target [target target ...]

where  [COMMANDS]  and  [OPTIONS]  are described below  and target is
a hostname either as full qualified domain name or as IP address.
Multiple commands and targets may be combined.

All  commands  and  options  can also be specified in a  rc-file, see
L</RC-FILE>  below.

=head1 QUICKSTART

Before going into  a detailed description  of the  purpose and usage,
here are some examples of the most common use cases:

For more specialised test cases, refer to the  L</COMMANDS>  and  L</OPTIONS> 
sections below. For more examples please refer to  L</EXAMPLES>  section.

For more details, please see  L</Requirements>  and  L</INSTALLATION>  below.

=head1 WHY?

Why a new tool for checking SSL security and configuration  when there
are already a dozen or more such good tools in existence (circa 2012)?

Unique features:

=over

=item * working in closed environments, i.e. without internet connection

=back

=over

=item * checking availability of ciphers independent of installed library

=back

=over

=item * checking for all possible ciphers (up to 65535 per SSL protocol)

=back

=over

=item * mainly same results on all platforms.

=back

Currently available tools suffer from some or all of following issues:

=over

=item * lack of tests of unusual SSL certificate configurations

=back

=over

=item * may return different results for the same checks on given target

=back

=over

=item * missing tests for modern SSL/TLS functionality

=back

=over

=item * missing tests for specific, known SSL/TLS vulnerabilities

=back

=over

=item * no support for newer, advanced, features e.g. CRL, OCSP, EV

=back

=over

=item * limited capability to create your own customised tests

=back

Other  reasons or problems  are that other tools are either binary or
use additional binaries and hence not portable to other platforms.

In contrast to (all?) most other tools, including L<openssl(1)|openssl(1)>, it can
be used to "ask simple questions" like "does target support STS" just
by calling:

	o-saft.pl +hsts_sts example.tld

For more, please see  L</EXAMPLES>  section below.

=head1 SECURITY

This tool is designed to be used by people doing security or forensic
analyses. Hence no malicious input is expected.

There are no special security checks implemented. Some parameters are
roughly sanatised according unwanted characters.  In particular there
are no checks according any kind of code injection.

Care should be taken, when additional tools and modules are installed
as described in  L</INSTALLATION>  below.  In particular  we recommend to
do such installations into directoies specially prepared for use with

	o-saft.pl . No other tools of your system should use these installations
i.e. by accident or because your environment variables point to them.

Note that compilation and installation of additional tools  (openssl, 
Net::SSLeay, etc.) uses known insecure configurations and features!
This is essential to make o-saft.pl able to check for such insecurities.

It is  highly recommended to do these installations and use the tools
on a separate testing system.

B<DO NOT USE THESE INSTALLATIONS ON PRODUCTIVE SYTEMS.>

=head1 TECHNICAL INFORMATION

It is important to understand, which provided information is based on
data returned by underlaying (used) libraries and the information 
computed directly.

=head2 openssl, libssl, libcrypto

In general the tool uses perl's L<Net::SSLeay(1)|Net::SSLeay(1)> module  which itself
is based on libssl and/or libssleay library of the operating system.
It's possible to use other versions of these libraries, see options:

=over

=item * --exe-path=PATH --exe=PATH

=back

=over

=item * --lib-path=PATH --lib=PATH

=back

=over

=item * --envlibvar=NAME

=back

The external L<openssl(1)|openssl(1)> is called to extract  some information from
its output.  The version of openssl can be controlled  with following
options:

=over

=item * --openssl=TOOL

=back

=over

=item * --no-openssl

=back

=over

=item * --force-openssl

=back

=over

=item * --exe-path=PATH --exe=PATH

=back

Above applies to all commands except  I<+cipherall>  which uses no other
libraries.

OpenSSL is recommended to be used for libssl and libcrypto.  Versions
0.9.8k to 1.0.2e (Jan. 2016) are known to work. However, versions be-
for 1.0.0 may not provide all informations.
LibreSSL is not recommended, because  some functionallity  considered
insecure, has been removed.
For more details, please see  L</INSTALLATION>  below.

=head2 Certificates and CA

All checks according the validity of the certificate chain  are based
on the root CAs installed on the system. NOTE that L<Net::SSLeay(1)|Net::SSLeay(1)> and
L<openssl(1)|openssl(1)> may have their own rules where to find the root CAs.
Please refer to the documentation on your system for these tools.
However, there are folloing options to tweak these rules:

=over

=item * --ca-file=FILE

=back

=over

=item * --ca-path=DIR

=back

=over

=item * --ca-depth=INT

=back

=head2 Commands and options

All arguments  starting with  C<+>  are considered  L</COMMANDS>  for this
tool. All arguments starting with  C<-->  are considered  L</OPTIONS>  for
this tool.

Reading any data from STDIN or here-documents is not yet supported.
It's reserved for future use.

=head2 Environment variables

Following environment variables are incorporated:

=over

=item * LD_LIBRARY_PATH - used and extended with definitions from options

=back

=over

=item * OPENSSL         - if set, full path to openssl executable

=back

=over

=item * OPENSSL_CONF    - if set, full path to openssl's openssl.cnf or

=back

                 directory where to find openssl.cnf

=head2 Requirements

For checking all ciphers and all protocols with  I<+cipherall>  command,
just perl (5.x) without any modules is required.

For  I<+info>  and  I<+check>  (and all related) commands,  perl (5.x) with
following modules (minimal version) is required:

=over

=item * IO              1.25 (2011)

=back

=over

=item * IO::Socket::SSL 1.37 (2011)

=back

=over

=item * IO::Socket::SSL 1.90 (2013)

=back

=over

=item * Net::DNS        0.66 (2011)

=back

=over

=item * Net::SSLeay     1.49 (2012)

=back

However, it is recommended to use the most recent version of the mod-
ules which then gives more accurate results and less warnings. If the
modules are missing, they can be installed i.e. with:

	cpan Net::SSLeay

Note: if you want to use advanced features of openssl or Net::SSLeay,
please see  INSTALLTION  section how to compile and install the tools
fully customized.

Also an openssl executable should be available, but is not mandatory.

For checking DH parameters of ciphers, openssl 1.0.2  or newer should
be available. If an older version of openssl is found, we try hard to
extract  the DH parameters from the  data returned by the server, see
I<+cipher-dh>  command.

=head1 RESULTS

All output is designed to be easily parsed by postprocessors.  Please
see  L</OUTPUT>  section below for details.

For the results,  we have to distinguish  those  returned by  I<+cipher>
command  and those from  all other tests and checks like   I<+check>  or
I<+info>  command.

=head3 +cipher

The cipher checks will return  one line for each  tested cipher. It
contains at least the cipher name,  C<yes>  or  C<no>  whether  it is
supported or not, and a security qualification. It may look like:

	AES256-SHA       yes    HIGH
	NULL-SHA         no     weak

Depending on the used  I<--legacy=*>  option the format may differ and
also contain more information.  For details see  I<--legacy=*>  option
below.

The text for security qualifications are (mainly) those returned by
openssl (version 1.0.1): LOW, MEDIUM, HIGH and WEAK.
The same texts, but with all lower case characters, are used if the
qualification was adapted herein. Following rules for adjusting the
qualification were used:

=over

=item * weak:

=back

=over

=item ** all *NULL* ciphers

=back

=over

=item ** all *RC4*  ciphers

=back

=over

=item ** all *EXPORT*  ciphers

=back

=over

=item ** all *anon* (aka ADH aka DHA) ciphers

=back

=over

=item * low:

=back

=over

=item ** all *CBC*  ciphers

=back

=over

=item * high:

=back

=over

=item ** all *CBC3* (aka 3DES) ciphers

=back

=over

=item ** all *AES(128|256)* ciphers

=back

=over

=item ** all *CAMELLIA* ciphers

=back

=head3 +check

These tests return a line with  a label  describing the test  and a
test result for it. The  idea is to report  C<yes>  if the result is
considered "secure"  otherwise report  C<no>  followed by the reason
why it's considered insecure. Example of a check considered secure:

	Label of the performed check:           yes

Example of a check considered insecure:

	Label of the performed check:           no (reason why)

Note  that there are tests where the results  appear confusing when
first viewed, like for www.wi.ld:

	Certificate is valid according given hostname:  no (*.wi.ld)
	Certificate's wildcard does not match hostname: yes

This can for example occur with:

	Certificate Common Name:                *.wi.ld
	Certificate Subject's Alternate Names:  DNS:www.wi.ld

Please check the result with the  I<+info>  command also to  verify if
the check sounds reasonable.

=head3 +info

The test result contains detailed information. The labels there are
mainly the same as for the  I<+check>  command.

=head1 COMMANDS

There are commands for various tests according the  SSL connection to
the target, the targets certificate and the used ciphers.

All commands are preceded by a  C<+>  to easily distinguish from other
arguments and options. However, some I<--OPTIONS> options are treated as
commands for historical reason or compatibility to other programs.

The most important commands are (in alphabetical order):
I<+check> I<+cipher> I<+info> I<+http> I<+list> I<+quick> I<+sni> I<+sni_check> I<+version>

A list of all available commands will be printed with:

	o-saft.pl --help=cmd

The description of all other commands will be printed with:

	o-saft.pl --header --help=commands

The summary and internal commands return requested information or the
results of checks. These are described below.

Note that some commands may be a combination of other commands, see:

	o-saft.pl --header --help=intern

The following sub-sections only describe the commands,  which do more
than giving a simple information from the target.  All other commands
can be listed with:

	o-saft.pl --header --help=commands

The final sub-sections  L</Notes about commands>  describes some notes
about special commands and related commands.


=head2 Commands for information about this tool

All these commands will exit after execution (cannot be used together
with other commands).

=head3 +ciphers

Show ciphers offered by local SSL implementation.

This commands prints the ciphers in a format like "openssl ciphers"
does. It also accepts the  -v  and  -V  option. The  I<--legacy=TYPE> 
option can be used as described for  I<+list>  command.
Use  I<+list>  command for more information according ciphers.

=head3 +list

Show all ciphers supported by this tool. This includes cryptogrphic
details of the cipher and some internal details about the rating.

In contrast to the  I<+ciphers>  command,  I<+list>  uses  TAB characters
instead of spaces to seperate columns.  It also prints table header
lines by default.

Different output formats are used for the  I<--legacy>  option:

=over

=item * --legacy=simple   tabular output of cipher values

=back

=over

=item * --legacy=full     as --legacy=simple but more data

=back

=over

=item * --legacy=openssl  output like with +ciphers command

=back

=over

=item * --legacy=ssltest  output like "ssltest --list"

=back

=head3 +VERSION

Just show version and exit.

=head3 +version

Show version information for both the program and the  Perl modules
that it uses, then exit.

Use  I<--v>  option to show more details.

=head3 +libversion

Show version of openssl.

=head3 +quit

Show internal data and exit, used for debugging only.

=head2 Commands to check SSL details

Following (summary and internal) commands are simply a shortcut for a
list of other commands. For details of the list use:

	o-saft.pl --help=intern

=head3 +check

Check the SSL connection for security issues. This is the same as:
I<+info> I<+cipher> I<+sizes> I<--sslv2> I<--sslv3> I<--tlsv1> I<--tlsv11> I<--tlsv12>
but also gives some kind of scoring for security issues if any.

=head3 +http

Perform HTTP checks (like STS, redirects etc.).

=head3 +info

Overview of most important details of the SSL connection.

Use  I<--v>  option to show details also, which span multiple lines.

=head3 +info--v

Overview of all details of the SSL connection. It is a shortcut for
all commands listed below but not including  I<+cipher>.

This command is intended for debugging as it prints some details of
the used L<Net::SSLinfo|Net::SSLinfo> module.

=head3 +quick

Quick overview of checks. Implies  I<--enabled>  and  I<--short>.

=head3 +pfs

Check if servers offers ciphers with prefect forward secrecy (PFS).

=head3 +sts

=head3 +hsts

Various checks according STS HTTP header.
This option implies  I<--http>,  means that  I<--no-http> is ignored.

=head3 +sni

Check for Server Name Indication (SNI) usage.

=head3 +sni_check

=head3 +check_sni

Check for Server Name Indication (SNI) usage  and  validity  of all
names (CN, subjectAltName, FQDN, etc.).

=head3 +bsi

Various checks according BSI TR-02102-2 and TR-03116-4 compliance.

=head3 +ev

Various checks according certificate's extended Validation (EV).

Hint: use option  I<--v> I<--v>  to get information about failed checks.

=head3 +sizes

Check length, size and count of some values in the certificate.

=head3 +s_client

Dump data retrieved from  "openssl s_client ..."  call. This should
be used for debugging only.
It can be used just like openssl itself, for example:

	openssl s_client -connect host:443 -no_sslv2

=head3 +dump

Dumps internal data for SSL connection and target certificate. This
is mainly for debugging and  should not be used together with other
commands (except I<+cipher>).
Each key-value pair is enclosed in  #{  and  #} .

Using  I<--trace> I<--trace>  dumps data of L<Net::SSLinfo|Net::SSLinfo> too.

=head3 +exec

Command used internally when requested to use other libraries.
This command should not be used directly.

=head2 Commands to test target's ciphers

=head3 +cipher

Check target for ciphers,  either all ciphers, or ciphers specified
with  I<--cipher=*>  option.

Note that ciphers not supported by the local SSL implementation are
not checked by default, use  I<+cipherall>  command for that.

=head3 +cipherall

=head3 +cipherraw

Check target for all possible ciphers.
Does not depend on local SSL implementation.

In contrast to  I<+cipher>  this command has some options to tweak the
cipher tests, connection results and some strange behaviours of the
target. See  L</Options for cipherall command>  for details.

=head3 +cipher-SSL

Get default cipher for protocol SSL.

=over

=item * C<SSL>       can be any of:

=back

           sslv2, sslv3, tls1, tls11, tls12, tls13, dtls1

=head2 Commands to test SSL connection to target

Please see:

	o-saft.pl --help=commands

=head2 Commands to show details of the target's certificate

Please see:

	o-saft.pl --help=commands

=head2 Notes about commands

=head3 +extensions vs. +tlsextensions

I<+extensions>  shows the "Certificate extensions" and  I<+tlsextensions>
will show the TLS protocol extensions.
Use  I<+tlsextdebug>  to show more informations about the TLS protocol
extensions.

=head3 +http2 +spdy +spdy3 +spdy31 +spdy4 +prots

These commands are just an alias for the  I<+protocols>  command.

Note  that the corresponding IP and reverse hostname may be missing
in some messages then.

=head3 --host=HOST

Specify HOST as target to be checked. Legacy option.

=head3 --port=PORT

Specify PORT of target to be used. Legacy option.

=head3 --host=HOST and --port=PORT and HOST:PORT and HOST

When giving more than one HOST argument,  the sequence of the given
HOST argument and the given  I<--port=PORT>  and the given I<--host=HOST>
options are important.
The rule how ports and hosts are mapped is as follows:

HOST:PORT arguments are used as is (connection to HOST on PORT)
only HOST is given, then previous specified  I<--port=PORT>  is used

Note that URLs are treated as HOST:PORT, if they contain a port.
Example:

	o-saft.pl +cmd host-1 --port 23 host-2 host-3:42 host-4

will connect to:

=over

=item * host-1:443

=back

=over

=item * host-2:23

=back

=over

=item * host-3:42

=back

=over

=item * host-4:23

=back

=head3 --proxyhost=PROXYHOST --proxy=PROXYHOST:PROXYPORT

Make all connection to target using PROXYHOST.

Also possible is: I<--proxy=PROXYUSER:PROXYPASS@PROXYHOST:PROXYPORT>

=head3 --proxyport=PROXYPORT

Make all connection to target using PROXYHOST:PROXYPORT.

=head3 --proxyuser=PROXYUSER

Specify username for proxy authentication.

=head3 --proxypass=PROXYPASS

Specify password for proxy authentication.

=head3 --starttls

Use C<STARTTLS> command to start a TLS connection via SMTP.
This option is a shortcut for  I<--starttls=SMTP> .

=head3 --starttls=SMTP

=head3 --starttls=PROT

Use C<STARTTLS> command to start a TLS connection via protocol. PORT
PORT may be any of: C<SMTP>, C<IMAP>, C<IMAP2>, C<POP3>, C<FTPS>, C<RDP>,
C<LDAP> or C<XMPP>

For  I<--starttls=SMTP>  see  I<--dns-mx>  also to use MX records instead
of host

=head3 --starttls-delay=SEC

Number of seconds to wait before sending a packet, to slow down the
C<STARTTLS> requests. Default is 0.
This may prevent blocking of requests by the target due to too much
or too fast connections.
Note:  In this case there is an automatic suspension and retry with
a longer delay.

=head3 --cgi

=head3 --cgi-exec

Internal use for CGI mode only.

=head2 Options for SSL tool

=head3 --s_client

Use  "openssl s_slient ..."  call to retrieve more information from
the SSL connection.  This is disabled by default on Windows because
of performance problems. Without this option (default on Windows !)
following informations are missing on Windows:

	compression, expansion, renegotiation, resumption,
	selfsigned, verify, chain, protocols, DH parameters

See L<Net::SSLinfo|Net::SSLinfo> for details.

If used together with  I<--trace>, s_client  data will also be printed
in debug output of L<Net::SSLinfo|Net::SSLinfo>.

=head3 --no-openssl

Do not use external "openssl"  tool to retrieve information. Use of
"openssl" is disabled by default on Windows.
Note that this results in some missing informations, see above.

=head3 --openssl=TOOL

C<TOOL>        can be a path to openssl executable; default: openssl

=head3 --openssl-cnf=FILE --openssl-conf=FILE

C<FILE>        path of directory or full path of openssl.cnf

If set, environment variable OPENSSL_CONF will be set to given path
(or file) when L<openssl(1)|openssl(1)> is started. Please see openssl's man page
for details about specifying alternate  openssl.cnf  files.

=head3 --force-openssl

Use openssl to check for supported ciphers;  default: L<IO::Socket(1)|IO::Socket(1)>

This option forces to use  "openssl s_slient -connect CIPHER .." to
check if a cipher is supported by the remote target. This is useful
if the  I<--lib=PATH>  option doesn't work (for example due to changes
of the API or other incompatibilities).

=head3 --exe-path=PATH

=head3 --exe=PATH

C<PATH>        is a full path where to find openssl.

=head3 --lib-path=PATH

=head3 --lib=PATH

C<PATH>        is a full path where to find libssl.so and libcrypto.so

See L</HACKER's INFO> below for a detailed description how it works.

=head3 --envlibvar=NAME

C<NAME>  is the name of a environment variable containing additional
paths for searching dynamic shared libraries.
Default is LD_LIBRARY_PATH.

Check your system for the proper name, i.e.:

	DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH, LIBPATH, RPATH, SHLIB_PATH.

=head3 --ssl-lazy

I.g. this tools tries to identify available functionality according
SSL versions from the underlaying libraries.  Unsupported  versions
are then disables and a warning is shown.
Unfortunately some libraries have  not implemented all functions to
check availability of a specific SSL version, which then results in
a compile error. 

This option disables the strict check of availability.
If the underlaying library doesn't support the required SSL version
at all, following error may occour:

=head3 --call=METHOD

C<METHOD>      method to be used for specific functionality

Available methods:

=over

=item * info-socket         use internal socket to retrieve information

=back

=over

=item * info-openssl        use external openssl to retrieve information

=back

=over

=item * info-user           use usr_getinfo() to retrieve information

=back

=over

=item * cipher-socket       use internal socket to ckeck for ciphers

=back

=over

=item * cipher-openssl      use external openssl to ckeck for ciphers

=back

=over

=item * cipher-user         use usr_getciphers() to ckeck for ciphers

=back


Method names starting with:

=over

=item * info-

=back

are responsible to retrieve information  about the SSL connection
and the target certificate (i.e. what the I<+info> command provides)

=over

=item * cipher-

=back

are responsible to connect to the target  and test if it supports
the specified ciphers  (i.e. what the  I<+cipher>  command provides)

=over

=item * check-

=back

are responsible for performing the checks (i.e. what's shown with
the  I<+check>  command)

=over

=item * score-

=back

are responsible to compute  the score based on check results

The second part of the name denotes which kind of method to call:

=over

=item * socket      the internal functionality with sockets is used

=back

=over

=item * openssl     the exteranl openssl executable is used

=back

=over

=item * user        the external special function, as specified in user's

=back

          L<o-saft-usr.pm|o-saft-usr.pm>,  is used.

Example:

	--call=cipher-openssl

will use the external L<openssl(1)|openssl(1)> executable to check the target for
supported ciphers.

Default settings are:

	--call=info-socket --call=cipher-socket --call=check-socket

Just for curiosity, instead of using:

	o-saft.pl --call=info-user --call=cipher-user --call=check-user --call=score-user ...

consider to use your own script like:

	#!/usr/bin/env perl
	usr_getinfo();usr_getciphers();usr_checkciphers();usr_score();

:-))

=head3 -v

Print list of ciphers in style like: "openssl ciphers -v".
Option used with  I<+ciphers>  command only.

=head3 -V

Print list of ciphers in style like: "openssl ciphers -V".
Option used with  I<+ciphers>  command only.

=head2 Options for SSL connection to target

=head3 --cipher=CIPHER

=over

=item * C<CIPHER>    can be any string accepeted by openssl or following:

=back

=over

=item * C<yeast>     use all ciphers from list defined herein, see  +list

=back

Beside the cipher names accepted by openssl, CIPHER can be the name
of the constant or the (hex) value as defined in openssl's files.
Currently supported are the names and constants of openssl 1.0.1k.
Example:

=over

=item * --cipher=DHE_DSS_WITH_RC4_128_SHA

=back

=over

=item * --cipher=0x03000066

=back

=over

=item * --cipher=66

=back

will be mapped to   DHE-DSS-RC4-SHA

Note: if more than one cipher matches, just one will be selected.

Default is C<ALL:NULL:eNULL:aNULL:LOW> as specified in L<Net::SSLinfo|Net::SSLinfo>.

=head3 --ignore-no-connect

A simple check if the target can be connected  will be performed by
default.  If this check fails, the target will be ignored, means no
more reuqested checks will be done.  As this connection check some-
times fails due to various reasons, the check can be disabled using
this option.

=head3 --no-md5-cipher

Do not use *-MD5 ciphers for other protocols than SSLv2.
This option is only effective with  I<+cipher>  command.

The purpose is to avoid warnings from L<IO::Socket::SSL(1)|IO::Socket::SSL(1)> like:

	Use of uninitialized value in subroutine entry at lib/IO/Socket/SSL.pm line 430.

which occours with some versions of L<IO::Socket::SSL(1)|IO::Socket::SSL(1)> when a *-MD5
ciphers will be used with other protocols than SSLv2.

Note that these ciphers will be checked for SSLv2 only.

=head3 --sslv2

=head3 --no-dtlsv12

=head3 --no-dtlsv13

=head3 --no-SSL

=over

=item * C<SSL>       can be any of:

=back

ssl, ssl2, ssl3, sslv2, sslv3, tls1, tls1, tls11, tls1.1, tls1-1,
tlsv1, tlsv11, tlsv1.1, tlsv1-1 (and similar variants for tlsv1.2).
For example:  I<--tls1>  I<--tlsv1>  I<--tlsv1_1>  are all the same.

(--SSL variants):    Test ciphers for this SSL/TLS version.
(--no-SSL variants): Don't test ciphers for this SSL/TLS version.

=head3 --no-tcp

Shortcut for:
I<--no-sslv2> I<--no-sslv3> I<--no-tlsv1> I<--no-tlsv11> I<--no-tlsv12> I<--no-tlsv13>

=head3 --tcp

Shortcut for:  I<--sslv2> I<--sslv3> I<--tlsv1> I<--tlsv11> I<--tlsv12> I<--tlsv13>

=head3 --no-udp

Shortcut for:
I<--no-dtlsv09> I<--no-dtlsv1> I<--no-dtlsv11> I<--no-dtlsv12> I<--no-dtlsv13>

=head3 --udp

Shortcut for:  I<--dtlsv09> I<--dtlsv1> I<--dtlsv11> I<--dtlsv12> I<--dtlsv13>

=head3 --nullsslv2

This option  forces  to assume that  SSLv2  is enabled  even if the
target does not accept any ciphers.

The target server may accept connections with  SSLv2  but not allow
any cipher. Some checks verify if  SSLv2  is enabled at all,  which
then would result in a failed test.
The default behaviour is to assume that  SSLv2 is not enabled if no
ciphers are accepted.

=head3 --http

Make a HTTP request if cipher is supported.

If used twice debugging will be enabled using  environment variable
C<HTTPS_DEBUG>.

=head3 --no-http

Do not make HTTP request.

=head3 --sni

Make SSL connection in SNI mode.

=head3 --no-sni

Do not make SSL connection in SNI mode (default: SNI mode).

=head3 --sni-toggle

=head3 --toggle-sni

Test with and witout SNI mode.

=head3 --force-sni

Do not check if SNI seems to be supported by L<Net::SSLeay(1)|Net::SSLeay(1)>.
Older versions of openssl and its libries do not support SNI or the
SNI support is implemented buggy. By default it's checked if SNI is
properly supported. With this option this check can be disabled.

Be warned that this may result in improper results.

=head3 --servername=NAME

=head3 --sni-name=NAME

Use NAME instead of given hostname to connect to target in SNI mode
By  default, NAME is automatically set to the given FQDN.
This is insufficient, when an IP instead of a FQDN was given,  then
the connection needs to specify the correct hostname (i.g. a FQDN).

For historical reason, the value C<1> is the same as if the the real
FQDN (given hostname) has been used.  If the value is empty, or the
value C<0> is given, no SNI name will be used.

Note: i.g. there is no need to use this option,  as a correct value
for the SNI name will be choosen automatically (except for IPs).
However, it's kind of fuzzing ...

=head3 --no-cert

Do not get data from target's certificate, return empty string.

=head3 --no-cert --no-cert

Do not get data from  target's certificate,  return  default string
of L<Net::SSLinfo|Net::SSLinfo> (see  I<--no-cert-text=TEXT>  option).

=head3 --no-cert-text=TEXT

Set C<TEXT> to be returned from L<Net::SSLinfo|Net::SSLinfo> if no certificate data
is collected due to use of  I<--no-cert>.

=head3 --ca-depth=INT

Check certificate chain to depth C<INT> (like openssl's -verify).

=head3 --ca-file=FILE

Use C<FILE> with bundle of CAs to verify target's certificate chain.

=head3 --ca-path=DIR

Use C<DIR> where to find CA certificates in PEM format.

=head3 --ca-force

=head3 --force-ca

B<NOT YET IMPLEMENTED>
I. g. openssl uses default settings where to find certificate files.
When  I<--ca-file=FILE>  and/or  I<--ca-path=DIR>  was used,  this default
will be overwritten by appropriate options passed to openssl. If the
default does not work as expected,  I<--force-ca>  can be used to force
setting of proper values according well known common defaults. See:

	o-saft.pl +version
	o-saft.pl +version --force-ca

to see the used settings.

=head3 --no-nextprotoneg

Do not use  -nextprotoneg  option for openssl.

=head3 --no-reconnect

Do not use  -reconnect  option for openssl.

=head3 --no-tlsextdebug

Do not use  -tlsextdebug  option for openssl.

=head3 --sclient-opt=VALUE

Argument or option passed to openssl's  s_client  command.

=head2 Options for cipherall command

=head3 --range=RANGE 

=head3 --cipherrange=RANGE

Specify range of cipher constants to be tested by  I<+cipherall>.
Following RANGEs are supported (see also:  I<--cipherrange=RANGE>):

=over

=item * C<rfc>               all ciphers defined in various RFCs

=back

=over

=item * C<shifted>           C<rfc>, shifted by 64 bytes to the right

=back

=over

=item * C<long>              like C<rfc> but more lazy list of constants

=back

=over

=item * C<huge>              all constants  0x03000000 .. 0x0300FFFF

=back

=over

=item * C<SSLv2_long>        more lazy list of constants for SSLv2 ciphers

=back

Note: C<SSLv2> is the internal list used for testing SSLv2 ciphers.
It does not make sense to use it for other protocols; however ...

=head3 --slow-server-delay=SEC 

Additional delay in seconds  after the server is connected  using a
proxy or before starting STARTTLS.
This is useful when connecting via  slow proxy chains or connecting
to slow servers before sending the STARTTLS sequence.

=head3 --ssl-maxciphers=CNT 

Maximal number of ciphers sent in a sslhello (default: 32).

=head3 --ssl-double-reneg

Send SSL extension  C<reneg_info>  even if list of ciphers includes
TLS_EMPTY_RENEGOTIATION_INFO_SCSV (default: do not include)

=head3 --ssl-nodata-nocipher

Some servers do not answer  (i.g. they disconnect) if  none of  the
offered ciphers is supported by the server.

Continue testing with next ciphers  when the target  disconnects or
does not send data within specified timeout (see I<--timeout>).
Useful for TLS intolerant servers.

=head3 --no-ssl-nodata-nocipher

Abort testing with next ciphers when the target disconnects.

=head3 --ssl-use-ecc

Use supported elliptic curves.  Default on.

=head3 --ssl-use-ec-point

Use TLS C<ec_point_formats> extension.  Default on.

=head3 --ssl-use-reneg

Test for ciphers with "secure renegotiation" flag set.
Default: don't set "secure renegotiation" flag.

=head3 --ssl-retry=CNT

=head3 --ssl-timeout=SEC

Number of seconds to wait until connection is qualified as timeout.

=head3 --dns-mx

=head3 --mx

(only useful with  I<--starttls=SMTP>).

=head2 Options for checks and results

Options used for  I<+check>  command:

=head3 --enabled

Only print result for ciphers accepted by target.

=head3 --disabled

Only print result for ciphers not accepted by target.

=head3 --ignorecase

Checks are done case insensitive.

=head3 --no-ignorecase

Checks are done case sensitive. Default: case insensitive.
Currently only checks according CN, alternate names in the target's
certificate compared to the given hostname are effected.

=head2 Options for output format

=head3 --short

Use short, less descriptive, text labels for  I<+check>  and  I<+info>
command.

=head3 --legacy=TOOL

For compatibility with other tools,  the output format used for the
result of the  I<+cipher>  command can be adjusted to mimic the format
of other SSL testing tools.

The argument to the  I<--legacy=TOOL>  option  is the name of the tool
to be simulated.

Following TOOLs are supported:

=over

=item * C<sslaudit>          format of output similar to  sslaudit

=back

=over

=item * C<sslcipher>         format of output similar to  ssl-cipher-check

=back

=over

=item * C<ssldiagnos>        format of output similar to  ssldiagnos

=back

=over

=item * C<sslscan>           format of output similar to  sslscan

=back

=over

=item * C<ssltest>           format of output similar to  ssltest

=back

=over

=item * C<ssltestg>          format of output similar to  ssltest -g

=over

=item * C<sslyze>            format of output similar to  sslyze

=back

=over

=item * C<ssl-cipher-check>  same as sslcipher

=back

=over

=item * C<ssl-cert-check>    format of output similar to  ssl-cert-check

=back

=over

=item * C<testsslserver>     format of output similar to  TestSSLServer.jar

=back

=over

=item * C<thcsslcHeck>       format of output similar to  THCSSLCheck

=back

Note that these legacy formats only apply to  output of the checked
ciphers. Other texts like headers and footers are adapted slightly.

Please do not expect identical output as the TOOL  when using these
options, it's a best guess and should be parsable in a very similar
way.

=head3 --legacy=compact

Internal format: mainly avoid tabs and spaces format is as follows:
   Some Label:<-- anything right of colon is data

=head3 --legacy=full

Internal format: pretty print each label in its own line,  followed
by data prepended by tab character (useful for  I<+info>  only).

=head3 --legacy=quick

Internal format: use tab as separator; ciphers are printed with bit
length (implies I<--tab>).

=head3 --legacy=simple

Internal default format.

=head3 --legacy=key

Internal format: print name of key instead of text as label. Key is
that of the internal data structure(s).  For ciphers and protocols,
the corresponding hex value is used as key.  Note that these values
are unique.

=head3 --format=0x

=head3 --format=\x

=head3 --format=/x

=head3 --format=hex

=head3 --format=raw

=over

=item * C<raw>       Print raw data as passed from L<Net::SSLinfo|Net::SSLinfo>.

=back

Note:  all data will be printed as is,  without  additional label
or formatting. It's recommended to use the  option in conjunction
with exactly one command.  Otherwise the user needs  to know  how
to "read"  the printed data.

=over

=item * C<hex>       Convert some data to hex: 2 bytes separated by C<:>.

=back

=over

=item * C<0x>        Convert some data with hex values:

=back

              2 bytes preceded by C<0x> and separated by a space.

=over

=item * C</x>        Same as  --format=\x

=back

=over

=item * C<\x>        Convert some data with hex values:

=back

              2 bytes preceded by C<\x> and no separating char.

=head3 --header

Print formatting header.  Default for  I<+check>,  I<+info>,  I<+quick>  and
and  I<+cipher>  only.

=head3 --no-header

Do not print formatting header.
Usefull if raw output should be passed to other programs.

Note: must be used on command line to inhibit all header lines.

=head3 --ignore-cmd=CMD

=head3 --ignore-output=CMD

=head3 --no-cmd=CMD

=head3 --no-output=CMD

Do not print output (data or check result) for command C<CMD>. C<CMD>
is any valid command, see  L</COMMANDS> ,  without leading C<+>.
Option can be used multiple times.

=head3 --score

Print scoring results. Default for  I<+check>.

=head3 --no-score

Do not print scoring results.

=head3 --separator=CHAR

=head3 --sep=CHAR

C<CHAR>    will be used as separator between  label and value of the
       printed results. Default is  C<:>.

=head3 --tab

C<TAB> character (0x09, \t)  will be used as separator between label
and value of the printed results.
As label and value are already separated by a  TAB  character, this
options is only useful in conjunction with the  I<--legacy=compact>
option.

=head3 --showhost

Prefix each printed line with the given hostname (target).
The hostname will be followed by the separator character.

=head3 --win-CR

Print windows-Style with CR LF as end of line. Default is NL only.

=head2 Options for compatibility with other programs

Please see other programs for detailed description (if not obvious:).
Note that only the long form options are accepted  as most short form
options are ambiguous.

Following list contains only those options not shown with:

=head2 Options for customization

For general descriptions please see  L</CUSTOMIZATION>  section below.

=head3 --cfg_cmd=CMD=LIST

=head3 --cfg-cmd=CMD=LIST

Redefine list of commands. Sets  %cfg{cmd-CMD}  to  LIST.  Commands
are written without the leading  C<+>.
CMD       can be any of:  bsi, check, http, info, quick, sni, sizes
Example:  I<--cfg-cmd=sni="sni> hostname"

To get a list of commands and their settings, use:

	o-saft.pl --help=intern

Main purpose is to reduce list of commands or print them sorted.

=head3 --cfg-score=KEY=SCORE

Redefine value for scoring. Sets  %checks{KEY}{score}  to  SCORE.
Most score values are set to 10 by default. Values C<0> .. C<100> are
allowed.

To get a list of current score settings, use:

	o-saft.pl --help=score

For deatils how scoring works, please see  L</SCORING>  section.

Use the  I<--trace-key>  option for the  I<+info>  and/or  I<+check> command
to get the values for  KEY.

=head3 --cfg_checks=KEY=TEXT

=head3 --cfg-checks=KEY=TEXT

=head3 --cfg_data=KEY=TEXT

=head3 --cfg-data=KEY=TEXT

Redefine texts used for labels in output. Sets  %data{KEY}{txt}  or
%checks{KEY}{txt}  to  TEXT.

To get a list of preconfigured labels, use:

	o-saft.pl --help=cfg-checks
	o-saft.pl --help=cfg-data

=head3 --cfg_text=KEY=TEXT

=head3 --cfg-text=KEY=TEXT

Redefine general texts used in output. Sets  %text{KEY}  to  TEXT.

=head3 --experimental

Use experimental functionality.
Some functionality of this tool is  under development and only used
when this option is given.

=head2 Options for tracing and debugging

=head3 --n

Do not execute, just show commands (only useful in conjunction with
using openssl).

=head3 Difference --trace vs. --v

While  I<--v>  is used to print more data,  I<--trace>  is used to  print
more information about internal data such as procedure names and/or
variable names and program flow.

=head3 --v

=head3 --verbose

Print more information about checks.

Note that this option should be first otherwise some debug messages
are missing.

Note that  I<--v>  is different from  -v  (see above).

For C<KEY> please see:  C<grep exit= o-saft.pl>

=head2 Options vs. Commands

For compatibility with other programs and lazy users,  some arguments
looking like options are silently taken as commands.  This means that
I<--THIS>  becomes  I<+THIS>  then. These options are:

=over

=item * --help

=back

=over

=item * --abbr

=back

=over

=item * --todo

=back

=over

=item * --chain

=back

=over

=item * --default

=back

=over

=item * --fingerprint

=back

=over

=item * --list

=back

=over

=item * --version

=back

Take care that this behaviour may be removed in future versions as it
conflicts with those options and commands which actually exist, like:

I<--sni>  vs.  I<+sni>

=head1 LAZY SYNOPSIS

=head2 Commands

Following strings are treated as a command instead of target names:

=over

=item * ciphers

=back

=over

=item * s_client

=back

=over

=item * version

=back

A warning will be printed.

=head2 Options

We support following options, which are all identical, for lazy users
and for compatibility with other programs.

=head3 Option Variants

=over

=item * --port PORT

=back

=over

=item * --port=PORT

=back

This applies to most such options,  I<--port>  is just an example.  When
used in the  L</RC-FILE>, the  I<--OPTION=VALUE>  variant must be used.

=head3 Option Names

Dash C<->, dot C<.> and/or underscore C<_> in option names are optional,
all following are the same:

=over

=item * --no.dns

=back

=over

=item * --no-dns

=back

=over

=item * --no_dns

=back

=over

=item * --nodns

=back

This applies to all such options,  I<--no-dns>  is just an example.

=head2 Targets

Following syntax is supported also:

	o-saft.pl http://some.tld other.tld:3889/some/path?a=b

Note that only the hostname and the port are used from an URL.

=head2 Options vs. Commands

See  L</Options vs. Commands>  in  L</OPTIONS>  section above

=head1 CHECKS

All SSL related check performed by the tool will be described here.

=head2 General Checks

Lookup the IP of the given hostname (FQDN), and then tries to reverse
resolve the FQDN again.

=head2 SSL Ciphers

Check which ciphers are supported by target. Please see  L</RESULTS>  for
details of this check.

=head2 SSL Connection

=head3 heartbeat

Check if heartbeat extension is supported by target.

=head3 poodle

Check if target is vulnerable to POODLE attack (SSLv3 enabled).

=head3 sloth

Check if target is vulnerable to SLOTH attack  (server offers RSA-MD5
or ECDSA-MD5 ciphers).

=head3 ALPN

Check if target supports ALPN. Following messages are evaluated:

	ALPN protocol: h2-14
	No ALPN negotiated

=head2 SSL Vulnerabilities

=head3 ADH

Check if ciphers for anonymous key exchange are supported: ADH|DHA.
Such key exchanges can be sniffed.

=head3 EDH

Check if ephemeral ciphers are supported: DHE|EDH.
They are necessary to support Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFS).

=head3 BEAST

Currently (2015) only a simple check is used: RC4 or CBC ciphers used.
Which is any cipher with RC4, ARC4 or ARCFOUR or with CBC.
TLSv1.2 checks are not yet implemented.

=head3 CRIME

Connection is vulnerable if target supports SSL-level compression.

=head3 DROWN

Connection is vulnerable if target supports SSLv2.

=head3 FREAK

Attack Against SSL/TLS to downgrade to EXPORT ciphers.
Currently (2015) a simple check is used:   SSLv3 enabled and EXPORT
ciphers supported by server.
See CVE-2015-0204 and https://freakattack.com/ .

=head3 HEARTBLEED

Check if target is vulnerable to heartbleed attack, see CVE-2014-0160
and http://heartbleed.com/ .

=head3 KCI

To perform a MiTM attack with Key Compromise Impersonation, the atta-
cker needs to engage the victim to install and use a client certificate.
This is considered a low risk and hence not tested here.

=head3 Logjam

Check if target is vulenerable to Logjam attack.
Check if target suports  EXPORT ciphers  and/or  DH Parameter is less
than 2048 bits. ECDH must be greater to 511 bits.

=head3 Lucky 13

Check if CBC ciphers are offered.
NOTE the recommendation to be safe againts  Lucky 13  was to use  RC4
ciphers. But they are also subjetc to attacks (see below).  Hence the
check is only for CBC ciphers.

=head3 RC4

Check if RC4 ciphers are supported.
They are assumed to be broken.
Note that  I<+rc4>  reports the vulnerabilitiy to the  RC4 Attack, while
I<+rc4_cipher>  simply reports if  RC4 ciphers are offered.  However the
check, and hence the result, is the same.

=head3 PFS

Check if DHE ciphers are used.  Checks also if the TLS session ticket
is random or not used at all.
Currently (2015) only a simple check is used: only DHE ciphers used.
Which is any cipher with DHE or ECDHE. SSLv2 does not support PFS.
TLSv1.2 checks are not yet implemented.

=head3 POODLE

Check if target is vulnerable to  POODLE attack (just check if  SSLv3
is enabled).

=head3 Practical Invalid Curve Attack

This attack allows an attacker to read the servers private key if the
server does not check properly the passed points for a ecliptic curve
when EDH ciphers are used.

This check will not send multiple invalid points,  but only checks if
the server closes the connection or responds with no matching cipher.

=head3 SLOTH

Currently (2016) we check for ciphers with  ECDSA, RSA-MD5.
Checking the TLS extension C<tls-unique> is not yet implemented.

=head2 Target (server) Configuration and Support

=head3 BEAST, BREACH, CRIME, DROWN, FREAK, Logjam, Lucky 13, POODLE, RC4, SLOTH

See above.

=head3 Renegotiation

Check if the server allows client-side initiated renegotiation.

=head3 Version rollback attacks

B<NOT YET IMPLEMENTED>
Check if the server allows changing the protocol.

=head3 DH Parameter

Check if target's DH Parameter is less 512 or 2048 bits.

=head2 Target (server) Certificate

=head3 Certificate Hashes

Check that fingerprint is not MD5.
Check that certificate private key signature is SHA2 or better.

=head3 Root CA

Provided certificate by target should not be a Root CA.

=head3 Self-signed Certificate

Certificate should not be self-signed.

=head3 IP in CommonName or subjectAltname (RFC6125)

=head3 Private Key encyption well known

Certificates signature key encryption algorithm is well known.

=head3 Public Key encyption

Certificates public key supports encryption.

=head3 Public Key encyption well known

Certificates public key encryption algorithm is well known.

=head3 Public Key Modulus size

Some (historic) SSL implementations are subject to buffer overflow if
the key exceeds 16384 or 32768 bits. The check is against 16384 bits.

=head3 Public Key Modulus Exponent size

The modulus exponent should be <= 65536 as some (mainly historic) SSL
implementations may have problems to connect.

=head3 Sizes and Lengths of Certificate Settings

Serial Number <= 20 octets (RFC5280, 4.1.2.2.  Serial Number)

B<...>

=head3 DV-SSL - Domain Validation Certificate

The Certificate must provide:

=over

=item * Common Name C</CN=> field

=back

=head2 Target (server) HTTP(S) Support

=head3 STS header

Using STS is no perfect security.  While the very first request using
http: is always prone to a MiTM attack, MiTM is possible to following
requests again, if STS is not well implemented on the server.

=over

=item * Request with http: should be redirected to https:

=back

=over

=item * Redirects should use status code 301 (even others will work)

=head2 Compliances

Note that it is not possible to satisfy all following compliances.
Best match is: C<PSF> and C<ISM> and C<PCI> and C<lazy BSI TR-02102-2>.
In general it is difficult to satisfy all conditions of a compliance,
and it is also difficult to check  all these conditions.  That is why
some compliance checks are not completely implemented.
For details see below please.

Also note that in the  L</RC-FILE>  the output of results for some checks
is disabled by default. A  C<!!Hint:>  message will be printed, if any
of these checks are used.

=head1 OUTPUT

All output is designed to make it  easily parsable by postprocessors.
Following rules are used:

=over

=item * Lines for formatting or header lines start with  C<=>.

=back

=over

=item * Lines for verbosity or tracing start with  C<#>.

=back

=over

=item * Errors and warnings start with  C<**>.

=back

=over

=item * Empty lines are comments ;-)

=back

=over

=item * Label texts end with a separation character; default is  C<:>.

=back

=over

=item * Label and value for all checks are separated by at least one  TAB

=back

character.

=over

=item * Texts for additional information are enclosed in C<<<>  and  C<>>>.

=back

=over

=item * C<N/A>  is used when no proper informations was found or provided.

=back

Replace  C<N/A>  by whatever you think is adequate:  "No answer",
"Not available",  "Not applicable",  ...

When used in  I<--legacy=full>  or I<--legacy=simple>  mode, the output may
contain formatting lines for better (human) readability.

=head2 Postprocessing Output

It is recommended to use the   I<--legacy=quick>   option, if the output
should be postprocessed, as it omits the default separation character
(C<:> , see above) and just uses on single tab character (0x09, \t  or
TAB) to separate the label text from the text of the result. Example:

	Label of the performed checkTABresult

More examples for postprocessing the output can be found here:

	https://github.com/OWASP/O-Saft/blob/master/contrib

=head1 CUSTOMIZATION

This tools can be customized as follows:

=over

=item * Using command line options

=back

This is a simple way to redefine  specific settings.  Please  see
L</CONFIGURATION OPTIONS>  below.

=over

=item * Using Configuration file

=back

A configuration file can contain multiple configuration settings.
Syntax is simply  KEY=VALUE. Please see L</CONFIGURATION FILE> below.

=over

=item * Using resource files

=back

A resource file can contain multiple command line options. Syntax
is the same as for command line options iteself.  Each  directory
may contain its own resource file. Please see  L</RC-FILE>  below.

=over

=item * Using debugging files

=back

These files are - nomen est omen - used for debugging purposes.
However, they can be (mis-)used to redefine all settings too.
Please see  L</DEBUG-FILE>  below.

=over

=item * Using user specified code

=back

This file contains  user specified  program code.  It can also be
(mis-)used to redefine all settings. Please see L</USER-FILE>  below.

Customization is done by redefining values in internal data structure
which are:  %cfg,  %data,  %checks,  %text,  %scores.

Unless used in  L</DEBUG-FILE>  or  L</USER-FILE>,  there is  no need to know
these internal data structures or the names of variables; the options
will set the  proper values.  The key names being part of the option,
are printed in output with the  I<--trace-key>  option.

I.g. texts (values) of keys in  %data are those used in output of the
"Information" section. Texts of keys in  %checks  are used for output
in "Performed Checks" section.  And texts of keys in  %text  are used
for additional information lines or texts (mainly beginning with C<=>).

=head3 Configuration File vs. RC-FILE vs. DEBUG-FILE

=over

=item * CONFIGURATION FILE

=back

Configuration files must be specified with one of the  I<--cfg-*>
options. The specified file can be a valid path. Please note that
only the characters:  a-zA-Z_0-9,.\/()-  are allowed as pathname.
Syntax in configuration file is:  C<KEY=VALUE>  where C<KEY> is any
key as used in internal data structure.

=over

=item * RC-FILE

=back

Resource files are searched for and used automatically.
For details see  L</RC-FILE>  below.

=over

=item * DEBUG-FILE

=back

Debug files are searched for and used automatically.
For details see  L</DEBUG-FILE>  below.

=over

=item * USER-FILE

=back

The user program file is included only  if the  I<--usr>  option was
used. For details see  L</USER-FILE>  below.

=head2 CONFIGURATION OPTIONS

Configuration options are used to redefine  texts and labels or score
settings used in output. The options are:

=over

=item * --cfg-cmd=KEY=LIST

=back

=over

=item * --cfg-score=KEY=SCORE

=back

=over

=item * --cfg-checks=KEY=TEXT

=back

=over

=item * --cfg-data=KEY=TEXT

=back

=over

=item * --cfg-text=KEY=TEXT

=back

KEY  is the key used in the internal data structure, and  TEXT is the
value to be set for this key.  Note that unknown keys will be ignored
silently.

If KEY=TEXT is an exiting filename, all lines from that file are read
and set. For details see  L</CONFIGURATION FILE>  below.

=head2 CONFIGURATION FILE

Note that the file can contain KEY=TEXT pairs for any kind of the
configuration as given by the  I<--cfg-CFG>  option.

For example  when used with  I<--cfg-text=file>  only values for  %text
will be set, when used with  I<--cfg-data=file>  only values for  %data
will be set, and so on. KEY is not used  when KEY=TEXT is an existing
filename. Though, it's recommended to use a non-existing key, i.e.:
I<--cfg-text=my_file=some/path/to/private/file> .

=head2 RC-FILE

The rc-file will be searched for in the working directory only.

The name of the rc-file is the name of the program file prefixed by a
C<.>  (dot),  for example:  C<.o-saft.pl>.

A  rc-file  can contain any of the commands and options valid for the
tool itself. The syntax for them is the same as on command line. Each
command or option must be in a single line. Any empty or comment line
will be ignored. Comment lines start with  C<#>  or  C<=>.

Note that options with arguments must be used as  C<KEY=VALUE> instead
of  C<KEY VALUE>.

Configurations options must be written like C<--cfg-CFG=KEY=VALUE>.
Where C<CFG> is any of:  cmd, check, data, text  or score and C<KEY> is
any key from internal data structure (see above).

All commands and options given on command line will  overwrite  those
found in the rc-file.

=head2 DEBUG-FILE

All debugging functionality is defined in L<o-saft-dbx.pm|o-saft-dbx.pm> , which will
be searched for using paths available in  C<@INC>  variable.

Syntax in this file is perl code.  For details see  L</DEBUG>  below.

=head2 USER-FILE

All user functionality is defined in  L<o-saft-usr.pm|o-saft-usr.pm> ,  which will be
searched for using paths available in  C<@INC>  variable.

Syntax in this file is perl code.

All functions defined in  L<o-saft-usr.pm|o-saft-usr.pm>  are called when the option
I<--usr>  was given.  The functions are defined as empty stub,  any code
can be inserted as need.  Please see   perldoc L<o-saft-usr.pm|o-saft-usr.pm>  to see
when and how these functions are called.

=head2 SHELL TWEAKS

Configurering the shell environment where the tool is startet, is not
not really a task for the tool itself, but it can simplify your life,
somehow.

There exist customizations for some commonly used shells,  please see
the files in the ./contrib/ directory.

=head1 CIPHER NAMES

While the SSL/TLS protocol uses integer numbers to identify  ciphers,
almost all tools use some kind of  "human readable"  texts for cipher
names. 

These numbers (which are most likely written  as hex values in source
code and documentations) are the only true identifier, and we have to
rely on the tools that they use the proper integers.

As such integer or hex numbers are difficult to handle by humans,  we
decided to use human readable texts. Unfortunately no common standard
exists how to construct the names and map them to the correct number.
Some, but by far not all, oddities are described in  L</Name Rodeo>.

The rules for specifying cipher names are:

=over

=item *           1) textual names as defined by IANA (see [IANA])

=back

=over

=item *           2) mapping of names and numbers as defined by IANA (see [IANA])

=back

=over

=item *           3) C<->  and  C<_>  are treated the same

=back

=over

=item *           4) abbreviations are allowed, as long as they are unique

=back

=over

=item *           5) beside IANA, openssl's cipher names are preferred

=back

=over

=item *           6) name variants are supported, as long as they are unique

=back

=over

=item *           7) hex numbers can be used

=back

[IANA]    http://www.iana.org/assignments/tls-parameters/tls-parameters.txt September 2013

[openssl] ... openssl 1.0.1

If in any doubt, use  I<+list> I<--v>  to get an idea about the mapping.
Use  I<--help=regex>  to see which regex are used to handle all variants
herein.

Mind the traps and dragons with cipher names and what number they are
actually mapped to. In particular when  I<--lib>,  I<--exe>  or  I<--openssl> 
options are in use. Always use these options with  I<+list> command too.

=head2 Name Rodeo

As said above, the  SSL/TLS protocol uses integer numbers to identify
ciphers, but almost all tools use some kind of  human readable  texts
for cipher names. 

For example the cipher commonly known as C<DES-CBC3-SHA> is identified
by C<0x020701c0> (in openssl) and has C<SSL2_DES_192_EDE3_CBC_WITH_SHA>
as constant name. A definition is missing in IANA, but there is 
C<TLS_RSA_WITH_3DES_EDE_CBC_SHA>.
It's the responsibility of each tool to map the human readable cipher
name to the correct (hex, integer) identifier.

For example Firefox uses  C<dhe_dss_des_ede3_sha>,  which is what?

Furthermore, there are different acronyms for the same thing in use.
For example  C<DHE>  and  C<EDH>  both mean "Ephemeral Diffie-Hellman".
Comments in the L<openssl(1)|openssl(1)> sources mention this.  And for curiosity
these sources use both in cypher names, but allow  C<EDH>  as shortcut
only in openssl's "ciphers"  command. Wonder about (up to 1.0.1h):

	openssl ciphers -V EDH
	openssl ciphers -V DHE
	openssl ciphers -V EECDH
	openssl ciphers -V ECDHE

Next example is  C<ADH>  which is also known as  C<DH_anon> or C<DHAnon>
or  C<DHA>  or  C<ANON_DH>. 

You think this is enough? Then have a look how many acronyms are used
for  "Tripple DES".

Compared to above, the interchangeable use of  C<->  vs.  C<_> in human
readable cipher names is just a very simple one. However, see openssl
again what following means (returns):

	openssl ciphers -v RC4-MD5
	openssl ciphers -v RC4+MD5
	openssl ciphers -v RC4:-MD5
	openssl ciphers -v RC4:!MD5
	openssl ciphers -v RC4!MD5

Looking at all these oddities, it would be nice to have a common unique
naming scheme for cipher names. We have not.  As the SSL/TLS protocol
just uses a number, it would be natural to use the number as uniq key
for all cipher names, at least as key in our internal sources.

Unfortunately, the assignment of ciphers to numbers  changed over the
years, which means that the same number refers to a  different cipher
depending on the standard, and/or tool, or version of a tool you use.

As a result, we cannot use human readable cipher names as  identifier
(aka unique key), as there are  to many aliases  for the same cipher.
And also the number  cannot be used  as unique key, as a key may have
multiple ciphers assigned.

=head1 KNOWN PROBLEMS

This section describes knwon problems, and known error messages which
may occour when using o-saft.pl. This sections can be used as FAQ too
as it gives hints and workarounds.

=head2 Segmentation fault

Sometimes  the program terminates with a  C<Segmentation fault>.  This
mainly happens if the target does not return certificate information.
If so, the  I<--no-cert>  option may help.

=head2 **WARNING: empty result from openssl; ignored at ...

This most likely occurs when the  provided cipher is  not accepted by
the server, or the server expects client certificates.

=head2 **WARNING: unknown result from openssl; ignored at ...

This most likely occurs when the L<openssl(1)|openssl(1)> executable is used with a
very slow connection. Typically the reason is a connection timeout.
Try to use  I<--timeout=SEC>  option.
To get more information, use  I<--v> I<--v>  and/or  I<--trace>  also.

=head2 **WARNING: undefined cipher description

May occour if ciphers are checked, but no description is available for
them herein. This results in printed cipher checks like:

	EXP-KRB5-RC4-MD5                no

instead of:

	EXP-KRB5-RC4-MD5                no       weak

=head2 **WARNING: Can't make a connection to your.tld:443; no initial data

=head2 **WARNING: Can't make a connection to your.tld:443; target ignored

This message occours if the underlaying  SSL library (i.e. libssl.a)
was not able to connect to the target. Known observed reasons are:

=over

=item * target does not support SSL protocol on specified port

=back

=over

=item * target expects a client certificate in ClientHello message

=back

More details why the connection failed can be seen using  I<--trace=2> .

If the targets supports SSL, it should be at least possible to check
for supported ciphers using  I<+cipherall>  instead of  I<+cipher> .

=head2 Use of uninitialized value $headers in split ... do_httpx2.al)

The warning message (like follows or similar):

	Use of uninitialized value $headers in split at blib/lib/Net/SSLeay.pm
	(autosplit into blib/lib/auto/Net/SSLeay/do_httpx2.al) line 1290.

occurs if the target refused a connection on port 80.
This is considered a bug in L<Net::SSLeay(1)|Net::SSLeay(1)>.
Workaround to get rid of this message: use  I<--no-http>  option.

=head2 invalid SSL_version specified at ... IO/Socket/SSL.pm

This error may occur on systems where a specific  SSL version is not
supported. Subject are mainly  SSLv2, SSLv3 TLSv1.3 and DTLSv1.
For DTLSv1 the full message looks like:

	invalid SSL_version specified at C:/programs/perl/perl/vendor/lib/IO/Socket/SSL.
See also  L</Note on SSL versions> .

Workaround: use option: I<--no-sslv2> I<--no-sslv3> I<--no-tlsv13> I<--no-dtlsv1>

=head2 Use of uninitialized value $_[0] in length at (eval 4) line 1.

This warning occours with IO::Socket::SSL 1.967, reason is unknown.
It seems not to harm functionality, hence no workaround, just ignore.

=head2 Use of uninitialized value in subroutine entry at lib/IO/Socket/SSL.pm line 430.

Some versions of  IO::Socket::SSL return this error message if  *-MD5
ciphers are used with other protocols than SSLv2.

Workaround: use  I<--no-md5-cipher>  option.

=head2 Can't locate auto/Net/SSLeay/CTX_v2_new.al in @INC ...

Underlaying library doesn't support the required SSL version.
See also  L</Note on SSL versions> .

Workaround: use  I<--ssl-lazy> option, or corresponding I<--no-SSL> option.

=head2 Read error: Connection reset by peer (,199725) at blib/lib/Net/SSLeay.pm\

=head2 (autosplit into blib/lib/auto/Net/SSLeay/tcp_read_all.al) line 535.

Error reported by some Net::SSLeay versions. Reason may be a timeout.
This error cannot be omitted or handled properly.

Workaround: try to use same call again (no guarantee, unfortunatelly)

=head2 openssl: ...some/path.../libssl.so.1.0.0: no version information available (required by openssl)

Mismatch of  openssl executable  and loaded underlaying library. This
most likely happens when options  I<--lib=PATH>  and/or  I<--exe=PATH>  are
used.  See also  L</Note on SSL versions> .

Hint: use following commands to get information about used libraries:

	o-saft.pl +version
	o-saft.pl --v --v +version

=head2 Integer overflow in hexadecimal number at ...

This error message may occour on  32-bit systems if perl was not com-
piled with proper options. I.g. perl automatically converts the value
to a floating pont number.
Please report a bug with output of following command:

	o-saft.pl +s_client +dump your.tld

=head2 <<openssl did not return DH Paramter>>

Text may be part of a value. This means that all checks according  DH
parameters and logkam attack cannot be done.

Workaround: try to use  I<--openssl=TOOL>  option.

This text may appears in any of the compliance checks (like I<+rfc7525>)
which may be a false positive.  For these checks openssl is also used
to get the DH Parameter.

Workaround: not available yet

=head2 No output with  +help  and/or  --help=todo

On some (mainly Windows-based) systems using

	o-saft.pl +help
	o-saft.pl --help

does not print anything.

Workaround: use  I<--v>  option.

	o-saft.pl +help --v

or

	o-saft.pl +help | more

=head2 **WARNING: on MSWin32 additional option  --v  required, sometimes ...

On some (mainly Windows-based) systems  this may happen  when calling
for example:

	o-saft.pl --help=FAQ

which then may produce:

	**WARNING: on MSWin32 additional option  --v  required, sometimes ...
	=== reading: ./.o-saft.pl (RC-FILE done) ===
	=== reading: Net/SSLinfo.pm (O-Saft module done) ===
	**USAGE: no command given
	# most common usage:
	o-saft.pl I+info&   your.tld&
	o-saft.pl I+check&  your.tld&
	o-saft.pl I+cipher& your.tld&
	# for more help use:
	o-saft.pl I--help&&

Workaround: use full path to perl.exe, for example
C:\Programs\perl\bin\perl.exe o-saft.pl I<--help=FAQ>

=head2 Performance Problems

There are various reasons when the program responds slow, or seems to
hang. Beside the problems described below performance issues are most
likely a target-side problem. Most common reasons are:

=over

=item *           a) DNS resolver problems

=back

Try with  I<--no-dns>

=over

=item *           b) target does not accept connections for https

=back

Try with  I<--no-http>

=over

=item *           c) target's certificate is not valid

=back

Try with  I<--no-cert>

=over

=item *           d) target expects that the client provides a client certificate

=back

No option provided yet ...

=over

=item *           e) target does not handle Server Name Indication (SNI)

=back

Try with  I<--no-sni>

=over

=item *           f) use of external L<openssl(1)|openssl(1)> executable

=back

Use  I<--no-openssl>

Other options which may help to get closer to the problem's cause:
I<--timeout=SEC>,  I<--trace>,  I<--trace=cmd>

=head1 LIMITATIONS

=head2 Commands

Some commands cannot be used together with others, for example:
I<+cipher>,  I<+ciphers>,  I<+list>,  I<+libversion>,  I<+version>,  I<+check>,  I<+help>,
I<+protocols> .

I<+quick>  should not be used together with other commands, it returns
strange output then.

I<+protocols>  requires L<openssl(1)|openssl(1)> with support for  C<-nextprotoneg>
option. Otherwise the value will be empty.

=head2 Options

The option  I<--port=PORT>  must preceed  I<--host=HOST>  for a target like
HOST:PORT  .

The characters  C<+> and C<=>  cannot be used for  I<--separator>  option.

Following strings should not be used in any value for options:
C<+check>, C<+info>, C<+quick>, C<--header>
as they my trigger the  I<--header>   option unintentional.

The used L<timeout(1)|timeout(1)> command cannot be defined with a full path like
L<openssl(1)|openssl(1)> can with the  I<--openssl=path/to/openssl> .

I<--cfg-text=file>  cannot be used to redefine the texts  C<yes> and C<no>
as used in the output for  I<+cipher>  command.

=head2 Checks (general)

=head3 +constraints

This check is only done for the certificate provided by the target.
All other certificate in the chain are not checked.

This is currently (2015) a limitation in o-saft.pl.

=head2 Broken pipe

This error message most likely means that the connection to specified
target was not possible (firewall or whatever reason).

=head2 Target Certificate Chain Verification

The systems default capabilities i.e. libssl.so, openssl, are used to
verify the target's certificate chain.  Unfortunately various systems
have implemented different  approaches and rules how identify and how
to report a successful verification.  As a consequence  this tool can
only return the  same information about the chain verification as the
used underlying tools.  If that information is trustworthy depends on
how trustworthy the tools are.

These limitations apply to following commands:

=over

=item * +verify

=back

=over

=item * +selfsigned

=back

Following commands and options are useful to get more information:

=over

=item * +chain_verify,  +verify,  +error_verify,  +chain,  +s_client

=back

=over

=item * --ca-file,  --ca-path,  --ca-depth

=back

=head2 User Provided Files

Please note that there cannot be any guarantee that the code provided
in the  L</DEBUG-FILE> L<o-saft-dbx.pm|o-saft-dbx.pm> or  L</USER-FILE> L<o-saft-usr.pm|o-saft-usr.pm> will
work flawless. Obviously this is the user's responsibility.

=head2 Problems and Errors

Checking the target for supported ciphers may return that a cipher is
not supported by the server  misleadingly.  Reason is most likely  an
improper timeout for the connection. See  I<--timeout=SEC>  option.

If the specified targets accepts connections but does not speak  SSL,
the connection will be closed after the system's TCP/IP-timeout. This
script will hang (about 2-3 minutes).

If reverse DNS lookup fails, an error message is returned as hostname,
like:  C<<<gethostbyaddr() failed>>>.
Workaround to get rid of this message: use  I<--no-dns>  option.

All checks for EV are solely based on the information provided by the
certificate.

Some versions of openssl (< 1.x) may not support all required options
which results in various error messages,  or  more worse,  may not be
visibale at all.
Following table shows the openssl option and how to disbale it within
o-saft:

=over

=item * nextprotoneg        --no-nextprotoneg

=back

=over

=item * reconnect           --no-reconnect

=back

=over

=item * tlsextdebug         --no-tlsextdebug

=back

=head2 Poor Systems

Use of L<openssl(1)|openssl(1)> is disabled by default on  Windows due to various
performance problems. It needs to be enabled with  I<--openssl>  option.

On Windows the usage of  "openssl s_client" needs to be enabled using
I<--s_client>  option.

On Windows it's a pain to specify the path for  I<--openssl=>..  option.
Variants are:

=over

=item * --openssl=/path/to/openssl.exe

=back

=over

=item * --openssl=X:/path/to/openssl.exe

=back

=over

=item * --openssl=\path\to\openssl.exe

=back

=over

=item * --openssl=X:\path\to\openssl.exe

=back

=over

=item * --openssl=\\path\\to\\openssl.exe

=back

=over

=item * --openssl=X:\\path\\to\\openssl.exe

=back

You have to fiddle around to find the proper one.

=head2 Debug and Trace Output

When both  I<--trace=key>  and  I<--trace=cmd>  options are used, output is
mixed, obviously. Hint: output for I<--trace=cmd> always contains "CMD".

=head1 DEPENDENCIES

All perl modules and all  private moduels and files  will be searched
for using paths  available in the  C<@INC>  variable.  C<@INC>  will be
prepended by following paths:

=over

=item * .

=back

=over

=item * ./lib

=back

=over

=item * INSTALL_PATH

=back

=over

=item * INSTALL_PATH/lib

=back

Where  C<INSTALL_PATH>  is the path where the tool is installed.
To see which files have been included use:

	o-saft.pl +version --v --user

=head1 INSTALLATION

The tool can be installed in any path. It just requres the modules as
described in  DEPENDENCIES  above. However, it's recommended that the
modules L<Net::SSLhello|Net::SSLhello> and L<Net::SSLinfo|Net::SSLinfo> are found in the directory
C<./Net/>  where  o-saft.pl  is installed.

For security reasons, most modern libraries  disabled or even removed
insecure or "dirty" functionality.  As the purpose of this tool is to
detect such insecure settings, functions, etc.,  it needs these dirty
things enabled. It needs (incomplete list):

=over

=item * insecure protocols like SSLv2, SSLv3

=back

=over

=item * more ciphers enabled, like NULL-MD5, AECDH-NULL-SHA, etc.

=back

=over

=item * some SSL extensions and options

=back

Therefore we recommend to compile and install at least following:

=over

=item * OpenSSL  with SSLv2, SSLv3 and more ciphers enabled

=back

=over

=item * Net::SSLeay  compiled with openssl version as described before.

=back

Please read the  SECURITY  section first before following the install
instructions below.

=head2 OpenSSL

Currently it is recommend to use either the openssl version from
https://github.com/PeterMosmans/openssl/ which requires compilation,
see  L</Example: Compile OpenSSL>, or use any of the precomiled versions
which are available for several platforms at https://testssl.sh/ .

The sources are available at

=over

=item * https://github.com/PeterMosmans/openssl/archive/1.0.2-chacha.zip

=back

The precomiled static versions are available at

=over

=item * https://github.com/drwetter/testssl.sh/tree/master/bin

=back

For all following installation examples we assume:

=over

=item * openssl-1.0.2-chacha.zip or openssl-1.0.2d.tar.gz

=back

=over

=item * /usr/local as base installation directory

=back

=over

=item * a bourne shell (sh) compatible shell

=back

=head2 Example: Precompiled OpenSSL

Simply download the tarball or zip file for your platform, unpack it,
and install (copy) the binaries into a directory of your choice.

=head2 Example: Compile OpenSSL

OpenSSL can be used from http://openssl.org/ or, as recommended, from
https://github.com/PeterMosmans/openssl/ .

OpenSSL-chacha
Compiling and installing the later is as simple as:

	unzip openssl-1.0.2-chacha.zip
	cd openssl-1.0.2-chacha
	./config --shared -Wl,-rpath=/usr/local/lib
	make
	make test
	make install

which will install openssl, libssl.so, libcrypto.so  and some include
files as well as the include files in  /usr/local/ .
The shared version of the libraries are necessary for  Net::SSLeay.

OpenSSL.org
Building openssl from the offical  openssl.org  sources requires some
patching before compiling and installing the libraries and binaries.

Example with openssl-1.0.2d:

	echo == unpack tarball
	tar xf openssl-1.0.2d.tar.gz
	cd openssl-1.0.2d

	echo == backup files to be modified
	cp ssl/s2_lib.c{,.bak}
	cp ssl/s3_lib.c{,.bak}
	cp ssl/ssl3.h{,.bak}
	cp ssl/tls1.h{,.bak}

	echo == patch files
	vi ssl/tls1.h         +/TLS1_ALLOW_EXPERIMENTAL_CIPHERSUITES/
          # define TLS1_ALLOW_EXPERIMENTAL_CIPHERSUITES  1

	vi ssl/ssl3.h ssl/s{2,3}_lib.c   +"/# *if 0/"
          #==> remove all   # if 0  and corresponding  #endif 
          #    except if lines contain:
          #        _FZA
          #        /* Fortezza ciphersuite from SSL 3.0
          #        /* Do not set the compare functions,
          #        if (s->shutdown & SSL_SEND_SHUTDOWN)

	echo == configure with static libraries
	echo omitt the zlib options if zlib-1g-dev is not installed
	echo omitt the krb5 options if no kerberos libraries available
	./config --prefix=/usr/local --openssldir=/usr/local/ssl \
     enable-zlib zlib zlib-dynamic enable-ssl2 \
     enable-krb5 I<--with-krb5-flavor=MIT> \
     enable-mdc2 enable-md2 enable-rc5  enable-rc2 \

     experimental-jpake -fPIC \
     -DTEMP_GOST_TLS -DTLS1_ALLOW_EXPERIMENTAL_CIPHERSUITES \
     shared

	echo == make binaries and libraries
	make depend
	make
	make test
	make install

	echo == if you want static binaries and libraries
	make clean
	echo same ./config as before but without shared option

     experimental-jpake -fPIC  -static \
     -DTEMP_GOST_TLS -DTLS1_ALLOW_EXPERIMENTAL_CIPHERSUITES

	make depend
	make
	make test
	echo next make will overwrite the previously installed dynamic
	echo shared openssl binary with the static openssl binary
	make install

=head2 Example: Compile Net::SSLeay

To enable support for ancient protocol versions,  Net::SSLeay must be
compiled manually after patching C<SSLeay.xs> (see below).
Reason is, that  Net::SSLeay  enables some functionality for  SSL/TLS
according the identified openssl version. There is, currently (2015),
no possibility to enable this functionality  by passing options on to
the configuration script C<perl Makefile.PL>.

Building our own library and module (with openssl from C</usr/local>):

	echo == unpack tarball
	tar xf Net-SSLeay-1.72.tar.gz
	cd Net-SSLeay-1.72

	echo == patch files
	echo "edit SSLeay.xs and change some #if as described below"
	env OPENSSL_PREFIX=/usr/local perl Makefile.PL PREFIX=/usr/local \
       INC=/usr/local/include  DEFINE=-DOPENSSL_BUILD_UNSAFE=1

	make
	make install
	cd /tmp & o-saft.pl +version&

SSLeay.xs needs to be changed as follows:

=over

=item * search for

=back

	#ifndef OPENSSL_NO_SSL2
	#if OPENSSL_VERSION_NUMBER < 0x10000000L

	const SSL_METHOD *
	SSLv2_method()

	#endif
	#endif

	#ifndef OPENSSL_NO_SSL3
	#if OPENSSL_VERSION_NUMBER < 0x10002000L

	const SSL_METHOD *
	SSLv3_method()

	#endif
	#endif

=over

=item * and replace by

=back

	const SSL_METHOD *
	SSLv2_method()

	const SSL_METHOD *
	SSLv3_method()

Note that  Net::SSLeay  will be installed in C</usr/local/> then. This
can be adapted to your needs by passing another path to the  C<PREFIX>
and  C<DESTDIR>  parameter.

Following command can be used to check  which methods are avilable in
Net::SSLeay, hence above patches can be verified:

	perl -MLNet::SSLinfo& -le 'print L&Net::SSLinfo&::test_ssleay();'&

=head2 Testing OpenSSL

After installation as descibed above finished, openssl may be tested:

	echo already installed openssl (found with PATH environment)
	openssl ciphers -v
	openssl ciphers -V -ssl2
	openssl ciphers -V -ssl3
	openssl ciphers -V ALL
	openssl ciphers -V ALL:COMPLEMENTOFALL
	openssl ciphers -V ALL:eNULL:EXP

	echo own compiled and installed openssl
	/usr/local/openssl ciphers -v
	/usr/local/openssl ciphers -V -ssl2
	/usr/local/openssl ciphers -V -ssl3
	/usr/local/openssl ciphers -V ALL
	/usr/local/openssl ciphers -V ALL:COMPLEMENTOFALL
	/usr/local/openssl ciphers -V ALL:eNULL:EXP

The difference should be obvious.
Note, the commands using  "ALL:COMPLEMENTOFALL"  and  "ALL:eNULL:EXP"
should return the same result.

=head2 Testing Net::SSLeay

As we want to test the separately installed  Net::SSLeay,  it is best
to do it with  o-saft.pl  itself:

	o-saft.pl +version

we should see a line similar to follwong at the end of the output:

	Net::SSLeay   1.72  /usr/local/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/perl/5.20.2/Net/SSLeay.pm

Now check for supported (known) ciphers:

	o-saft.pl ciphers -V

we should see lines similar to those of the last C</usr/local/openssl>
call. However, it should contain more cipher lines.

=head2 Stand-alone Executable

Some people asked for a stand-alone executable (mainly for Windows).
Even perl is a scripting language there are situations where a stand-
alone executable would be nice, for example if the installed perl and
its libraries are outdated, or if perl is missing at all.

Currently (2016) there a at least following possibilities to generate
a stand-alone executable:

=over

=item * perl with PAR::Packer module

=back

	pp -C -c o-saft.pl
	pp -C -c o-saft.pl -M Net::DNS -M Net::SSLeay -M IO::Socket \
             -M L<Net::SSLinfo|Net::SSLinfo> -M L<Net::SSLhello|Net::SSLhello>

	pp -C -c checkAllCiphers.pl
	pp -C -c checkAllCiphers.pl -M Net::DNS

=over

=item * ActiveState perl with its perlapp

=back

	perlapp --clean o-saft.pl
	perlapp --clean o-saft.pl -M Net::DNS -M Net::SSLeay -M IO::Socket \

	perlapp --clean checkAllCiphers.pl
	perlapp --clean checkAllCiphers.pl -M Net::DNS

=over

=item * perl2exe from IndigoSTar

=back

	perl2exe o-saft.pl
	perl2exe checkAllCiphers.pl

For details  on building the executable,  for example how to include
all required modules, please refer to the documentation of the tool.

=head1 HACKER's INFO

=head2 Note on SSL versions

Automatically detecting the supported SSL versions of the underlaying
system is a hard job and not always possible. Reasons could be:

=over

=item * used perl modules (Socket::SSL, Net::SSLeay) does not handle errors

=back

properly. Erros may be:

	invalid SSL_version specified at ... IO/Socket/SSL.pm
	Use of uninitialized value in subroutine entry at lib/IO/Socket/SSL.pm

There're some workarounds implemented since version 15.11.15 .

=over

=item * the underlaying libssl does not support the version, which then may

=back

result in segmentation fault

=over

=item * the underlaying libssl is newer than the perl module and the module

=back

has not been reinstalled. This most often happens with  Net::SSLeay
This can be detected with (see version numbers for Net::SSLeay):

	o-saft.pl +version

=over

=item * perl (in particular a used module, see above)  may bail out  with a

=back

compile error, like

	Can't locate auto/Net/SSLeay/CTX_v2_new.al in @INC ...

There're some workarounds implemented since version 15.11.15 .

We try to detect unsupported versions and disable them automatically,
a warning like follwoing is shown then:

	**WARNING: SSL version 'SSLv2': not supported by openssl

All such warnings look like:

	**WARNING: SSL version 'SSLv2': ...

If problems occour with  SSL versions, following commands and options
may help to get closer to the reason or can be used as workaround:

	o-saft.pl +version
	o-saft.pl +version --v
	o-saft.pl +version | grep versions
	o-saft.pl +version | grep 0x
	o-saft.pl +protocols your.tld
	o-saft.pl +protocols your.tld --no-rc

Checking for SSL version is done at one place in the code, search for

	supported SSL versions

However, there are some dirty hacks where  SSLv2 and SSLv3 is checked
again.

=head2 Using private libssl.so and libcrypt.so

For all  cryptographic functionality  the libraries  installed on the
system will be used. In particular perl's L<Net::SSLeay(1)|Net::SSLeay(1)> module, the
system's  libssl.so and libcrypt.so  and the L<openssl(1)|openssl(1)> executable.

It is possible to provide your own libraries, if the  perl module and
the executable are  linked using  dynamic shared objects  (aka shared
library, position independent code).
The appropriate option is  I<--lib=PATH>.

On most systems these libraries are loaded at startup of the program.
The runtime loader uses a preconfigured list of directories  where to
find these libraries. Also most systems provide a special environment
variable to specify  additional paths  to directories where to search
for libraries, for example the  LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable.
This is the default environment variable used herein.  If your system
uses  another name it must be specified with the  I<--envlibvar=NAME> 
option, where  NAME  is the name of the environment variable.

=head2 Understanding  --exe=PATH, --lib=PATH, --openssl=FILE

If any of  I<--exe=PATH>  or  I<--lib=PATH>  is provided, the pragram calls
(C<exec>) itself recursively with all given options, except the option
itself. The environment variables  C<LD_LIBRARY_PATH>  and C<PATH>  are
set before executing as follows:

=over

=item * prepend  C<PATH>  with all values given with  --exe=PATH

=back

=over

=item * prepend  C<LD_LIBRARY_PATH>  with all values given with --lib=PATH

=back

This is exactly, what L</Cumbersome Approach> below describes. So these
option simply provide a shortcut for that.

Note that  I<--openssl=FILE>  is a full path to the  openssl  executable
and will not be changed.  However, if it is a relative path, it might
be searched for using the previously set  C<PATH>  (see above).

Note that  C<LD_LIBRARY_PATH>  is the default.  It can be changed with
the  I<--envlibvar=NAME>  option.

While  I<--exe>  mainly impacts the L<openssl(1)|openssl(1)> executable,  I<--lib>  also
impacts o-saft.pl itself, as it loads other shared libraries if found.

Bear in mind that  all these options  can affect the behaviour of the
openssl subsystem,  influencing both  which executable is called  and
which shared libraries will be used.

NOTE that no checks are done if the options are set proper. To verify
the settings, following commands may be used:

	o-saft.pl --lib=YOU-PATH --exe=YOUE-EXE +version
	o-saft.pl --lib=YOU-PATH --exe=YOUE-EXE --v +version
	o-saft.pl --lib=YOU-PATH --exe=YOUE-EXE --v --v +version

Why so many options?  Exactly as described above, these options allow
the users to tune the behaviour of the tool to their needs.  A common
use case is to enable the use of a separate openssl build independent
of the openssl package used by the operating system.  This allows the
user fine grained control over openssl's encryption suites  which are
compiled/available, without affecting the core system.

=head2 Caveats

Depending on your system and the used modules and executables, it can
be tricky to replace the configured shared libraries with own ones.
Reasons are:

=over

=item *           a) the linked library name contains a version number,

=back

=over

=item *           b) the linked library uses a fixed path,

=back

=over

=item *           c) the linked library is searched at a predefined path,

=back

=over

=item *           d) the executable checks the library version when loaded.

=back

Only the first one a) can be circumvented.  The last one d) can often
be ignored as it only prints a warning or error message.

To circumvent the "name with version number" problem try following:

=over

=item *         1) use L<ldd(1)|ldd(1)> (or a similar tool) to get the names used by openssl:

=back

	ldd /usr/bin/openssl

which returns something like:

	libssl.so.0.9.8 => /lib/libssl.so.0.9.8 (0x00007f940cb6d000)
	libcrypto.so.0.9.8 => /lib/libcrypto.so.0.9.8 (0x00007f940c7de000)
	libdl.so.2 => /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libdl.so.2 (0x00007f940c5d9000)
	libz.so.1 => /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libz.so.1 (0x00007f940c3c1000)
	libc.so.6 => /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc.so.6 (0x00007f940c02c000)
	/lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2 (0x00007f940cdea000)

Here only the first two libraries are important.  Both,  libcrypto.so
and libssl.so  need to be version "0.9.8" (in this example).

=over

=item *         2) create a directory for your libraries, i.e.:

=back

	mkdir /tmp/dada

=over

=item *         3) place your libraries there, assuming they are:

=back

	/tmp/dada/libssl.so.1.42
	/tmp/dada/libcrypto.so.1.42

=over

=item *         4) create symbolic links in that directory:

=back

	ln -s libssl.so.1.42    libssl.so.0.9.8
	ln -s libcrypto.so.1.42 libcrypto.so.0.9.8

=over

=item *         5) test program with following option:

=back

	o-saft.pl +libversion --lib=/tmp/dada
	o-saft.pl +list --v   --lib=/tmp/dada

or:

	o-saft.pl +libversion --lib=/tmp/dada -exe=/path/to-openssl
	o-saft.pl +list --v   --lib=/tmp/dada -exe=/path/to-openssl

=over

=item *         6) start program with your options, i.e.:

=back

	o-saft.pl --lib=/tmp/dada +ciphers

This works if L<openssl(1)|openssl(1)> uses the same shared libraries as
L<Net::SSLeay(1)|Net::SSLeay(1)>,  which most likely is the case.

It's tested with Unix/Linux only. It may work on other platforms also
if they support such an environment variable and the installed
L<Net::SSLeay(1)|Net::SSLeay(1)> and L<openssl(1)|openssl(1)> are linked using dynamic shared
objects.

Depending on  compile time settings  and/or  the location of the used
tool or lib, a warning like following may occur:

	WARNING: can't open config file: /path/to/openssl/ssl/openssl.cnf

This warning can be ignored, usually as  req  or  ca  sub commands of
openssl is not used here. 
To fix the problem, either use  I<--openssl-cnf=FILE>  option or set the
the environment variable OPENSSL_CONF properly.

=head3 Cumbersome Approach

A more cumbersome approach to call  this program is to set  following
environment variables in your shell:

	PATH=/tmp/dada-1.42/apps:$PATH
	LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/tmp/dada-1.42

=head3 Windows Caveats

I.g. the used libraries on Windows are libeay32.dll and ssleay32.dll.

Windows also supports the LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable. If it
does not work as expected with that variable, it might be possible to
place the libs in the same directory as the  corresponding executable
(which is found by the PATH environment variable).

=head2 Using CGI mode

This script can be used as  CGI application. Output is the same as in
common CLI mode, using  C<Content-Type:text/plain>.  Keep in mind that
the used modules like L<Net::SSLeay(1)|Net::SSLeay(1)> will write some debug messages
on  STDERR instead  STDOUT.  Therefore multiple  I<--v>  and/or  I<--trace> 
options behave slightly different.

No additional external files like  L</RC-FILE>  or  L</DEBUG-FILE>  are read
in CGI mode; they are silently ignored.
Some options are disabled in CGI mode  because they are dangerous  or
don't make any sense.

=head3 WARNING

There are  no  input data validation checks implemented herein. All 
input data is url-decoded once and then used verbatim.
More advanced checks must be done outside before calling this tool.

It is not recommended to run this tool in CGI mode.
You have been warned!

=head2 Using user specified code

There are some functions called within the program flow, which can be
filled with any perl code.  Empty stubs of the functions are prepared
in L<o-saft-usr.pm|o-saft-usr.pm>.  See also  L</USER-FILE>.

=head1 DEBUG

=head2 Debugging, Tracing

Following  options and commands  are useful for hunting problems with
SSL connections and/or this tool. Note that some options can be given
multiple times to increase amount of listed information. Also keep in
mind that it's best to specify  I<--v>  as very first argument.

Note that the file L<o-saft-dbx.pm|o-saft-dbx.pm> is required,  if any  I<--trace*>  or
I<--v>   option is used.
