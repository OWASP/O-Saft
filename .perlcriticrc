#? NAME
#?      .perlcriticrc  - configuration for Perl::Critic for O-Saft
#?
#? SYNOPSIS
#?      perlcritic <filenames> ...
#?
#? DESCRIPTION
#?      This file contains the configuration for  Perl::Critic,  perlcritic.
#?      The settings are explained, why they are ENABLED or DISABLED.
#?

#?       FIXME: this file is a first attempt, not yet completed.

#?
#? EXAMPLES
#?      # the usual way
#?          perlcritic <filenames>
#?
#?      # print policy for each message
#?          perlcritic <filenames> --verbose 8
#?
#?      # print full description for each message
#?          perlcritic <filenames> --verbose 10
#?
#?      # check for a single policy (Subroutines::RequireFinalReturn)
#?          perlcritic <filenames> --single-policy  Subroutines::RequireFinalReturn
#?          perlcritic <filenames> --only --include Subroutines::RequireFinalReturn
#?
#?      # just get a statistic for severity 4 and 5
#?          perlcritic <filenames> --severity 4 --statistics-only
#?
#?      # get a a quick overview for violations of severity 4 and 5
#?          perlcritic *.pl *.pm --severity 4 --count
#?
#? LIMITATIONS
#?      Do not use perlcritic with an directory as parameter in the development
#?      directory as there are  too much matching files (i.e. SCCS/*) which may
#?      cause problems. Use list of files instead:   *.pl *.pm Net/*.pm

verbose     = 8
    # always want to see the policy name

    # does not work as described by Perl::Critic :-/

[ControlStructures::ProhibitPostfixControls]
    allow   = if unless
    #allow  = foreach
	# as the severity is already 2, its okay to report foreach violations


    # Message
	# Postfix control "if" used at line ...

    # CHECK adapted
	# Postfix controls are used often to have the relevant code far left!


[InputOutput::RequireCheckedClose]
    severity = 1

    # Message
	# Return value of "close" ignored at line ...

    # CHECK DISABLED
	# For our purpose it's nice if the files is closed, but not necessary.
	# hence severity reduced to 1


#[InputOutput::RequireCheckedOpen]
#[InputOutput::RequireCheckedSyscalls]


[InputOutput::RequireBriefOpen]
    lines    = 15
    severity = 2

    # Message
	# Close filehandles as soon as possible after opening them at line ...

    # CHECK adapted
	# Because we have more code until close, sometimes.
	# TODO: lines= seems not to work as descibed, produces false positives
	#         therefore serverity is reduced


[InputOutput::RequireEncodingWithUTF8Layer]

    # Message
	# I/O layer ":utf8" used at line 

    # CHECK ENABLED
    # CHECK adapted
	# However ...
        # The description of Perl::Critic is mainly valid according input. But
        # Perl::Critic  also complains for output and states, cite:
        #  "For consistency's sake, this policy checks files opened for output
        #   as well as input, For complete coverage it also checks `binmode()'
        #   calls, where the direction the operation can not be determined."
        # This is wrong, as binmode() usually uses the common  bare word  file
        # handles like STDOUT, STDERR, STDIN undoublty.
        # Our code uses binmode() only for output, hence this check is a false
        # positive. As this check should be active for future changes, we mark
        # all our binmode() calls with a proper  ## no critic .


[InputOutput::ProhibitBacktickOperators]
    only_in_void_context = 1

    # Message
	# Backtick operator used at line ...

    # CHECK ENABLED
	# Literal backticks are not used, but the qx() operator. Backticks are
	# used in void context, hence the restriction to only_in_void_context.


[InputOutput::ProhibitBarewordFileHandles]
[InputOutput::ProhibitTwoArgOpen]

    # Messages:
	# Bareword file handle opened at line ...
	# Two-argument "open" used at line ...

	# A bareword is a  series of characters  (like the FH)  without quotes
	# around them, or without a sigil in-front of them. They can be used in
	# some places, but in file-handles they are not recommended any more.

    # Recommendation
	# Always use lexical variables and always use 3-parameter for open. 


[-InputOutput::ProhibitExplicitStdin]

    # Message
	# Use "<>" or "<ARGV>" or a prompting module instead of "<STDIN>" at line ...

    # CHECK DISABLED
	# The reason why  "*ARGV behaves like *STDIN"  is described as
	# "is almost always what you want"  sounds strange.
	# In our usage this is never the case, because we also may get data on
	# STDIN and have command line arguments.

    severity = 3

    # Message
	# "require" statement with library name as string at line ...

    # CHECK ENABLED
    # CHECK adapted
	# FIXME: O-Saft uses require like:  require "o-saft-man.pm";
	# which is necessary because the filename contains a - (dash), without
	# quotes Perl complains with:
	#    Bareword "saft" not allowed while "strict subs" in use
	#
	# To get rid of this critic, the filename needs to be changed.  That's
        # why we leave this violation but reduce the severity to 3.
